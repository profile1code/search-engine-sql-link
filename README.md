A random project I worked on around a year ago. It is a search engine linked to a local MySQL database I made with questions and answer in it. The user could search for anything they wished and any related results would appear in the box. The user could then click on the question and a response would pop up, or if they wanted, could auto generate a response with GPT 3.5. Questions could also be added to a seperate database with the button in the bottom right.
